# Load-balancing-of-fat-tree-topology-using-SDN-controller
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging technology in the field of networking.
Nowadays clients are using large amount of data which needs to be handled by the network
which creates a lot of traffic. For a single server it becomes difficult to handle all the load. The
solution to this is to use multiple servers. The requests are sent to the load balancer. The client
requests are then forwarded to the servers depending on the load balancing strategy used. Earlier
hardware was used which turned out to be expensive and inefficient. Traditional load balancer
are vendor locked, non-programmable because network administrators cannot create their own
algorithms. On the other hand SDN load balancers are programmable and allow you to design
and implement your own load balancing strategy. Additional use of SDN load balancer is it does
not need dedicated hardware. In this project we are implementing and comparing our algorithm
using RYU controller ,Mininet.
